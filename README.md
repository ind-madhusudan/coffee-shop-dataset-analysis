## üìù Process

### üßπ Data Preparation
Here are the key steps involved in preparing the dataset for analysis:

1. **Import the Dataset**  
   - Load the dataset into your analysis environment (e.g., Python, R, Excel).
   - If using Python, use `pandas` to load CSV files with `pd.read_csv()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - **Handle Missing Data:**
     - Identify and fill or remove missing values using appropriate techniques (`fillna()`, `dropna()` in Python).
   - **Remove Duplicates:**
     - Check for duplicate rows and remove if necessary.
   - **Trim Spaces:**  
     - Remove leading or trailing spaces in text fields (e.g., `.strip()` method in Python or Excel's TRIM function).
   - **Find & Replace:**  
     - Standardize text entries (e.g., replace inconsistent values like "coffee" vs "Coffee").
   - **Verify Consistency:**  
     - Ensure column formats are correct, e.g., date columns should be of `datetime` type.

3. **Format Date and Time Columns**  
   - Convert columns related to date and time into the correct formats for analysis.
4. **Standardize Product Categories and Locations**  
   - Ensure that product categories and store locations are consistent (e.g., "espresso" vs. "Espresso").  

5. **Remove Outliers and Errors**  
   - Identify and handle outliers or incorrect data values (e.g., sales values that are negative or excessively high).

6. **Created New Variables**  
   - Derived new columns such as "Month", "Day of Week", or "Hour of Day" based on existing date and time information.

7. **Verify Data Consistency and Correctness**  
   - Run basic checks to ensure that the data looks correct and is ready for analysis.
